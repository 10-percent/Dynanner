## Summary ##
  People are busy. Busy people make mistakes. Do you ever make the same mistake twice? Now you don't have to. Learn from your mistakes by keeping a Dynanner. First you log an activity. After you do the activity, you log feedback for yourself in your Dynanner. What did you do well? What would you like to improve on? Next time you plan a similar activity, your Dynanner will provide you with that feedback. You don't have to worry about organizing your journal entries in a constructive manner; the Dynanner does that for you.

## Customer Quote ##
  "My Dynanner has not only helped me to learn from my past experiences, but I have become so much more mindful of what I'm doing in my everyday life! For a long time, I couldn't figure out why I was never getting past the first date, but after I started using my Dynanner, I realized that I was making people uncomfortable by talking about my problems. Using my Dynanner allowed me to reflect on the specific behaviors that I was exhibiting that caused my endeavors to fail, then reminded me of those behaviors next time I scheduled a similar activity. Thanks Dynanner!"
